### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data generalist with background in software development and academic research. I use modern data stack technologies to create data infrastructure, R/tidyverse for data analysis, and Python for ML. (But I'm also no stranger to GNU Make, bash/zsh, and vim when appropriate.)
